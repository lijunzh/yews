Yews | Your Earthquake Waveform Solution
========================================

Yews is a deep learning toolbox for processing seismic waveform made with flexibility, speed, and usability in mind. It is built upon `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_ for researchers interested in applying deep learning techniques on seismic waveform data.



Installation
============

conda:

.. code:: bash

   conda install yews -c lijunzhu


pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip install yews


From source:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install


Note:

1. These assume that you have `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ installed via the default method.

2. Yews can be installed via *conda-forge* with all dependencies handled automatically; however, it only supports the **CPU** version as *PyTorch* does not have a **GPU** version for the conda-forge channel.



Documentation
=============

Under construction.
